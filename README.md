# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-clustering
Overview

Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset.

What is Customer Segmentation

Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.

Companies that deploy customer segmentation are under the notion that every customer has different requirements and require a specific marketing effort to address them appropriately. Companies aim to gain a deeper approach of the customer they are targeting.

 K-Means Algorithm
 
 While using the k-means clustering algorithm, the first step is to indicate the number of clusters (k) that we wish to produce in the final output. The algorithm starts by selecting k objects from dataset randomly that will serve as the initial centers for our clusters. These selected objects are the cluster means, also known as centroids.

 Dataset
 
 The dataset consists of following five features of 200 customers:
 1. CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to the customer
 2. Gender: Gender of the customer
 3. Age: Age of the customer
 4. Annual Income (k$): Annual Income of the customer
 5. Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.
